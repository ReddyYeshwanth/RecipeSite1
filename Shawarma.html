            Shawarma is prepared by stacking strips of marinated meat and fats
            alternately on a vertical spit, resulting in a large block of meat &
            fats. The block of meat is grilled slowly while the spit rotates.
            Grilled meat is shredded off from the spit when needed and served as
            an appetizer or used to make shawarma wraps or rolls.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>
            Make chicken: In a large bowl, whisk together oil, lemon juice,
            garlic, and seasonings. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and
            refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
            Preheat oven to 425Â° and grease a large baking sheet with cooking
            spray. Add onion to marinade and toss to coat. Remove chicken and
            onion from marinade and place on prepared baking sheet. Bake until
            chicken is golden and cooked through, 30 minutes. Let chicken rest
            on cutting board for 5 minutes, then thinly slice.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, make yogurt sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together
            yogurt, lemon juice, oil, and garlic. Season with salt and a pinch
            of red pepper flakes. To serve as a pita, top warmed pitas with
            chicken, onion, romaine, tomatoes, cucumber, and yogurt sauce.
