            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground fenugreek seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped cilantro, plus cilantro leaves for garnish</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>Garam masala</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>
            Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large, deep skillet over high
            heat. Season chicken with salt and add to skillet. Cook chicken
            until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken
            pieces to a large bowl. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to
            skillet along with jalapeños and dried red chiles. Cook over
            moderately high heat until sizzling, about 30 seconds. Add onions,
            garlic and ginger to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until
            deep brown, about 8 minutes.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
            Spoon onion mixture into a food processor. Add coriander, cumin,
            fenugreek seeds, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, paprika and 1 teaspoon of
            salt and puree. Transfer onion mixture to skillet. Add tomatoes and
            chopped cilantro to the food processor and puree.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
            Return chicken pieces to skillet along with any accumulated juices.
            Cook over moderate heat, stirring, until onion sauce begins to
            stick, about 8 minutes. Stir yogurt into skillet, then stir in
            pureed tomato and cilantro. Simmer curry over moderately low heat,
            turning chicken pieces occasionally, until cooked through, about 50
            minutes (add 1/4 cup of water to skillet towards the end of cooking
            if the sauce gets too thick). Season curry with salt and transfer
            chicken to a platter. Pour sauce on top, sprinkle with garam masala
            and cilantro leaves and serve.
